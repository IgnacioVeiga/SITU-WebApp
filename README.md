## About "SITU"
/// To be redacted ///

## Components
The descriptions mentioned below do not necessarily represent the actual state of the application and its operation, as well as the ultimate goal of each component.

### Auth
You can register a bus company with a user as administrator and login with the email and a password generated by [backend](https://github.com/IgnacioVeiga/SITU-Backend) and sent to that email.

### Alerts
List, review and create alerts. Alerts are created by both company users and ordinary users. They are used to notify users and the company of any event that affects the use of the company's transportation.

### Reports
The reports are created by common users with the objective of denouncing an act committed by the company's employees to their superiors or to leave a comment to the company about a bad experience in order to improve their business.

### Users
In the user area you can only list and modify company users, you can also add users from outside the company and modify your password.

### Bus map
It is used to list/add/modify/delete bus transport lines, their routes and stops. Here inside another component is used as a map (using several Leaflet libraries) where the above mentioned can be visualized and modified.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
